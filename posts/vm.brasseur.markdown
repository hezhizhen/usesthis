### Who are you, and what do you do?

Hello there! I'm [VM Brasseur](https://www.vmbrasseur.com/ "Vicky's website."), but because we're all friends here you can call me Vicky. I'm the author of [many articles](https://www.vmbrasseur.com/publications-interviews/ "Vicky's published articles.") and [one book](https://pragprog.com/titles/vbopens/forge-your-future-with-open-source/ "Vicky's book about open source."), a [public speaker](https://www.vmbrasseur.com/presentations/ "Vicky's presentations."), and a corporate open source strategist. This means I help companies use, release, and contribute to free and open source software (FOSS) in ways that are good for their bottom line _and_ for the communities. I'm also a FOSS advocate without portfolio, working with and advising all projects that need it rather than strongly identifying as a member of any one community. This allows me to make a lot of cross-community connections and serve FOSS better. (Relatedly: thanks to a [recent layoff](https://anonymoushash.vmbrasseur.com/2020/06/01/farewell-juniper "Vicky's post about being laid off from Juniper Networks."), I'm on the market. [Hire me](https://vmbrasseur.com/resume.pd "Vicky's resume.")!)

### What hardware do you use?

The following assumes a home setup. My job requires a lot of travel (I spent nearly 70% of 2019 on the road), which is a different hardware setup. I have that written up [over here](https://anonymoushash.vmbrasseur.com/2019/11/25/my-travel-habits/ "Vicky's post about travel habits."). Obviously, the travel setup isn't really needed right now, what with my country totally stuffing its attempts at curtailing the spread of a pandemic. But I digress…

**The Desktop:** My workspace is basic, minimal, and mostly empty. The desk itself is a couple of [IKEA FINNVARD][finnvard] trestles topped with a [HILVER bamboo desktop][hilver]. My chair is a [Haworth Very Office Chair][very] that I got a heckuva deal on from a local used office furniture store. On the desk itself: a [13" 2017 MacBook Pro][macbook-pro], an [Anker PowerPort Speed PD 5][powerport-speed-pd-5] (under the desk, actually, but this thing is so great I can't not mention it), an [mStand laptop stand][mstand], a [27" HP Z27i ZDisplay][z27i] on a bog standard adjustable monitor arm, a boring but perfect for me [Apple Magic keyboard][magic-keyboard] accompanied by an [Apple Magic Trackpad 2][magic-trackpad-2], a [Blue Snowball microphone][snowball], and finally a [Logitech C920 HD webcam][c920] that lives on top of the ZDisplay.

**The Music:** About the only time there isn't music playing somewhere in the house is when I'm sleeping, so my musical devices are very important to me. I have a headphone addiction so I have many of those, but the ones that get the most use are my [Bose Altos][alto] when I'm out and about (yes, they're kitschy but I love them), my [Bowers & Wilkins P7 Wireless][p7-wireless] when I'm at my desk (superb sound and comfort), and my [Powerbeats Pro][powerbeats-pro] anywhere and everywhere (these easily kick [Airpod][airpods] ass in sound, comfort, and usability). When I'm doing stuff around the house (read: not using headphones) I kick it old school using the reliable tech I've been using since the turn of the century: Slim Devices (now Logitech) [Squeezeboxes][squeezebox] and [Booms][squeezebox-boom] streaming music from my [Ubuntu][] server running [Squeezeserver][squeezebox-server].

**The Wetware:** Beverages are nearly as important to my productivity as music. While I adore coffee (each morning features a 200ml inverted [Aeropress][] of hand-ground Sweet Maria's beans home-roasted in a [Behmor 2000AB Plus][2000ab-plus]; yes, I'm _That Person_), tea is my primary productivity lubrication when I'm at home. The majority of my tea is looseleaf from Upton, served in a vintage Swan Brand 'The Carlton' teapot. While I have a [Cuisinart CPK-17 kettle][cpk-17], in 2018 I bought a [Zojirushi CD-WCC30 water boiler][cd-wcc30] and it's been a life-changer.

**The Mobile:** My mobile devices don't get much of a workout unless I'm on the road. Still, I suppose they deserve a mention since they're pretty important to me in many ways. After reading the above it'll probably be no surprise to learn that they're all Apple devices: [iPhone 8][iphone-8], a gen one 9.7" [iPad Pro][ipad-pro] with equally vintage [Apple Pencil][pencil] and [Smart Keyboard/cover][smart-keyboard]. I wrote a massive amount of my book on that iPad Pro. It's perfect for those little airplane tray tables. The mobile device that gets the most daily use is my [Apple Watch 4][apple-watch-series-4], mostly for checking weather, tracking activity, and seeing the time in other regions.

### And what software?

I'm in tech, and I've been telecommuting for at least 13 years, so a lot of my life is online. This means I use a ton of software. To be honest, I didn't realise exactly how much software I relied on until I started making a list for this article.

**The Exobrain:** I have a mind like a steel sieve, write everything down (digitally speaking), and review it all constantly. The core of it all is my Exobrain, without which my life grinds to a halt and to which I refer dozens of times every single day. Larger projects and initiatives get tracked in [Trello][], discrete steps - and every other task or todo item in my lifei - all go into [Remember The Milk][remember-the-milk] (RTM), and web clippings go into [Evernote][]. To be honest, if [Apple Notes][notes] had good meta-tagging and web clipping then I'd rather use it instead. But it doesn't, so I keep Evernote. It gets the job done. [Zotero][] is priceless for storing and cataloguing all of the research papers I read.

**The Writing:** If I write it, it's written in [Markdown][] and stored in [Git][], or more specifically in repositories in [GitLab][]. Every presentation, article, blog post, website, and even my book are in version control. I prefer the [GitHub Desktop client][github-desktop] on my Mac and [Working Copy][working-copy-ios] on the iPad, but I do spend time at the command line by way of [iTerm2][]. My editor of choice is [MacVim][] on my Mac or [Textastic][textastic-ios] on my iPad Pro, but I'm becoming more of a fan of the editor that's included with Working Copy as well.

**The Communication:** I love email. It's is such a wonderful and powerful tool and it's the core of my communications. Because email is so important to my life and my productivity, I entrust it to professionals rather than to a search engine. Specifically, I entrust it to [Pobox][]/[FastMail][], who rock so hard. I love them. Until recently, I used [Apple Mail][mail] as my email client, but its support for inline email replies is rubbish so now I use [Postbox][], which is literally [Thunderbird][] but it works. Instant messaging is almost as important as email for me. I spend most of my IM time in [IRCCloud][], which handles not only my IRC networks but also the innumerable [Slacks][slack] that we all find ourselves in lately. [Signal][], [Apple Messages][messages], and [Discord][] also get a lot of use. [Zoom][] and [Facetime][] are my preferences (in that order) for video communication and have been even before the pandemic hit.

**The Presenting:** Public speaking and conference presentations are a huge part of my job. I used to use [Keynote][] but discovered [Deckset][] a few years ago and instantly fell in love. Deckset has transformed how I write, prepare, and deliver my talks. For brainstorming talks and everything else, I rely on [MindNode][mindnode-ios] for mind mapping and [Procreate][procreate-ios] for my mobile whiteboard. [Color Oracle][color-oracle] helps me ensure my presentations will work for people with different visual abilities.

**The Rest:** And then there are all the tools that I don't have enough of to form separate categories. [Safari][] is my browser, thanks to its speed and impressively low power and memory use. [Twitter](https://twitter.com/vmbrasseur "Vicky's Twitter account.") is central to a lot of what I do, and the desktop version of [Tweetbot][] is my tool of choice there. A lot of my industry news comes from there, but increasingly more of it is via my RSS feeds in [Newsblur][]. [1Password][] creates my passwords and ensures they're secure. [Alfred][] helps me find and launch stuff on my Mac. [Dropbox][] is my primary cloud storage service but I'm slowly transitioning that to [iCloud][]. While iCloud is my primary photo backup, [Flickr][] is the photo service I prefer for sharing. [TunnelBear][] keeps the snoops out of my network when I'm on the road. [Every Time Zone][every-time-zone] ensures I know what time it is elsewhere before I accidentally schedule colleagues for meetings at 4AM in their location.

**The Elephant in the Room:** Yes, my life is dedicated to furthering Free and Open Source Software and its communities. No, pretty much none of my hardware or software is FOSS. I used Linux and free software as my daily driver for about ten years, then I realised how much of my time was spent wrestling with my tools instead of getting stuff done. I switched to the Apple ecosystem because it allowed me to get stuff done quickly and effectively. I sometimes catch flack from the less enlightened members of the FOSS world for that, but I have no regrets. When I have need for a new tool or to replace an old one, I evaluate FOSS and proprietary options. When a FOSS tool meets my usability needs I choose it, and happily. Unfortunately, that doesn't happen very often.

### What would be your dream setup?

My setup is constantly up for reevaluation and evolution (for instance, the recent mail client change I mentioned), so there aren't many changes that I know of that I haven't already made. The only ones I can think of are things that aren't possible yet. For instance..

Hey, Postbox and Trello? Could you two please get together and, like, integrate or something? I wanna be able to right-click on a message, select a Board/Card, then either add a new card or add the message as a card comment including the primary email headers (To, From, Cc, Subject, Date). This would make my life immensely easier, since right now I need to go to the Trello window, find the board, find the card, open the sharing options, copy the card email address, then forward, Bcc, or resend the email message. I do that many times a day and it's a pain.

Another thing that's currently not possible is Deckset on the iPad. Frankly, there's little that I do that requires a Mac except for Deckset. If the team were able to release an iPad version it would open the door to my traveling with one fewer device, and a large one at that. Rumour has it that they're looking into it, so maybe some day soon? I hope?

The final thing I'd like is an office in a home that I own. My current home office is lovely and all (probably my fave ever to this point), but as a renter I'm limited in the potential improvements I can consider. Hopefully this is something I can fix in the next couple of years.

Oh, and a dog. My cats might not agree, but we need a doggo fren around here. That'd be the best. I'd post so many dog pictures to Flickr and Twitter, omg. I'd be insufferable. 🐶
