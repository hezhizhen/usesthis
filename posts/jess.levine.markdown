### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm Jess Levine, and I'm a multi-disciplinary creator. I author both fiction and non-fiction, write tabletop roleplaying games and video games, produce music, and am both a programmer and political organizer. You can find my science fiction in [Clarkesworld](https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/levine_02_22/ "Jess' sci-fi writing in Clarkesworld.") and my political non-fiction in [Seize the Press](https://www.seizethepress.com/2022/02/07/nfts-marxism-and-enclosure-the-worlds-most-dangerous-fan-club-card/ "Jess' article about NFTs on Seize the Press."), [Blood Knife](https://bloodknife.com/issue-12-playlist/ "Jess' cyberpunk playlist on Blood Knife."), and on my [Medium](https://medium.com/@jessica.s.levine "Jess' Medium account.") and [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/jessfromonline "Jess' Patreon account."). You can find my video and tabletop games on [my itch.io page](https://jessfromonline.itch.io/ "Jess' itch.io account."). My unreleased game "I Have the High Ground", a "two-player collaborative dueling TTRPG of banter, posturing, and capes," can be found on [its crowdfunding page](https://www.gameontabletop.com/cf710/i-have-the-high-ground.html "Jess' TTRPG game on Game On."), where - at the time of writing - you can still late-pledge! I prefer people find my music on [Bandcamp](https://liquidcrystal.bandcamp.com/album/archive "Jess' Bandcamp account."), but it also appears on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2okYdq0U7Ls1FAEx61mKcU "Jess' music on Spotify.") and other major streaming platforms. My code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/jessicalevine "Jess' GitHub account."). I've also appeared on podcasts demonstrating [my](https://www.partyofonepodcast.com/2022/02/15/316-i-have-the-high-ground-with-jess-levine/ "Jess talking about I Have The High Ground on the Party of One podcast.") [tabletop](http://actualplay.roleplayingpublicradio.com/2022/02/systems/misc/going-rogue/going-rogue-overexposed/ "Jess talking about Going Rogue on the Role Playing Public Radio podcast.") [games](https://www.partyofonepodcast.com/2021/07/30/292-going-rogue-with-jess-levine/ "Jess talking about Going Rogue on the Party of One podcast.") and talking about both [music](https://settingtherecordqueer.libsyn.com/37-synthwave-with-jess-from-online "Jess talking about her music on Setting the Record Queer.") and [politics](https://cosmonautmag.com/2021/08/communism-and-the-disabled-with-maddie-and-jess/ "Jess talking politics on Cosmonaut."). You can find all of this work and more on my website, [jessfrom.online](https://jessfrom.online/ "Jess' website."), where you can also find my freelancing rates - I offer editing, writing, and music production services. Finally, as my handle implies, I am _extremely_ on Twitter and you can find me there as [@jessfromonline](https://twitter.com/jessfromonline "Jess' Twitter account.").

### What hardware do you use?

I use a [MacBook Pro][macbook-pro] for most writing and programming, while music production happens on my custom built Windows machine. While a younger me prioritized flashy desktop cases like my old [NZXT Phantom][phantom], an older me just wanted something compact, cheap, and easy to move, like my current [NZXT H510][h510]. I also adore my [Das Keyboard 4][das-keyboard-4] - I've never owned a better keyboard. I received a set of [AirPods][] because my wife got them for free and decided they didn't want them. Wireless earbuds have since become a vital part of my life, because I have learned half my skills - if not more - by listening to podcasts and audiobooks during any waking hours I spend alone.

_Music_: I produce music using an [AKAI MPK249 MIDI controller][mpk249]. On the go, I instead carry an [AKAI MPKmini II][mpk-mini-mkii]. I learned synthesis on the KORG volca series of inexpensive analog synthesizers and eventually on a [Novation Bass Station II][bass-station-ii], though I sold them all to purchase an [OP-1 digital synthesizer][op-1] that I now use to generate samples. I record audio using a [Shure SM58 microphone][sm58] plugged into a [Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 audio interface][scarlett-2i2]. I mix on [Kali Audio LP-6 studio monitors][lp-6] and a Rokit 10S subwoofer alongside [beyerdynamic DT 880 semi-open studio headphones][dt-880]. For one album, I ran digitally-synthesized guitar audio out into a [TC HALL OF FAME reverb pedal][hall-of-fame], because I couldn't find any reverb VST that sounded exactly that good when applied to a guitar.

### And what software?

_Organization_: In order to keep track of my various projects and ideas, I have a multi-tiered notetaking and drafting system, resembling something like a [computer's memory hierarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_hierarchy "The Wikipedia entry for memory hierarchy."). The most spontaneous notes get entered into [Telegram][]'s Saved Messages feature, usually as either voice messages or text generated through iPhone voice dictation. On multiple occasions, I've "written" thousands of words of brainstorming while driving somewhere, using just my voice. From there, more permanent and organized notes are moved to or written in [Google Keep][google-keep] lists. When notes graduate to a draft, they are migrated to [Google Docs][google-docs] - which also acts as a version control system and distribution platform for drafts of my written work. Final products are converted to relevant formats and stored along with the rest of my life in [Dropbox][]. Reference links and my reading queue are indexed and tagged in [Zotero][]. These cloud apps essentially operate as an extension of my brain and memory, and I'd be helpless without them! All of my writing and game design happens within them. [Google Calendar][google-calendar] determines what I'm doing in a given moment and Google Keep also tracks my todo lists. In [Gmail][], I use manually applied tags like "Action Needed" to remind myself to revisit emails. In my political organizing work as an arbiter for [Philly Socialists](https://www.phillysocialists.org/ "A political organisation in Philadelphia."), we use [Trello][] to coordinate everything that the arbiter team needs to do.

_Games_: While most software I use to write tabletop games is covered under organization, I format some games in [Affinity Designer][affinity-designer] and write video games using [Twine][].

_Music_: I produce music in [Ableton Live][live], though I sometimes return to [FL Studio][fl-studio] to use the noise reduction of its unparalleled clip editor, Edison. I use a number of invaluable VST plugins, including: [Gullfoss][] for automated EQ, FabFilter [Pro-Q][] and [Pro-DS][] for EQ and de-essing, [Melodyne][] for autotune and [Maserati VX1][maserati-vx1] and [Satin][] for vocal effects, [API 2500][api-2500] for mastering, [Glitch 2][glitch] for sample manipulation, Valhalla plugins for reverb, most of the Goodhertz suite, and more. When it comes to softsynths, I use [SubLab][] for bass. I use [TAL-U-No-LX][], [FM8][], the [Arturia V Collection][v-collection], and the [KORG Legacy Collection][legacy-collection] to emulate classic synthesizers for synthwave music. I use [Massive][], [Spire][], and built-in Ableton synths for general synthesis. I use [Splice][] to acquire samples, and I especially love the Shigeto and Bedroom Beats & Lofi Hip-Hop packs.

_Programming_: Almost all my code is written happens in [Vim][] and my [lightsaber](https://www.vimgeeks.org/2012/10/monday-1022-jedi-text-editing-at-vim.html "A Vim Geeks meeting about treating your vim config file like a lightsaber.") - which can be found [here](https://github.com/jessicalevine/vim-config "Jess' vim config on GitHub.") - includes plugins such as: vim-powerline for UI, [nerdtree][the-nerd-tree] for file browsing, [ctrlp][] for search, [Supertab][] for tab completion, everything from tpope, and more. On [macOS][], I use [iTerm][iterm2] with the [zsh][] shell and with the agnoster theme and once again [powerline][] for UI. My editor and terminal both use [Solarized][] Dark for colors. Occasionally, I use [Sublime Text][sublime-text] for quick editing and search capabilities. I prefer to program in [Ruby][] and have written a number of [my own][logman] [CLI tools][gittake] in it to make my life easier. I use [git][] for version control.

_Miscellaneous_: I cannot use macOS without immediately installing [Alfred][] for convenient search functionality and navigation through files, windows, applications, and more. I also immediately download [SizeUp][] for resizing and tiling windows - though I used to use [ShiftIt][], a free SizeUp alternative. I also use [BetterTouchTool][] for customizing keyboard and trackpad shortcuts. I use [Adobe Photoshop][photoshop] and [Illustrator][] for image editing. I've yet to find a single decent video editor, so let me know if you have one. I use [Squarespace][] to host my website and a RAM-eating number of [Tweetdeck][] columns to manage Twitter. I use [Discord][] for collaboration, [Pidgin][] for IRC on Windows, and [Adium][] for IRC on macOS. I use [Plex][] as a media server and [Prologue][prologue-ios] to stream audiobooks to my iPhone from Plex. I use [Pocket Casts][pocket-casts-ios] to listen to podcasts and [Voice Dream][voice-dream-reader-ios] to read me books and articles that don't have an audio version. I use [Firefox][] as my browser. For security, I use [AirVPN][] and [Tor Browser][tor], and I use [Signal][] for encrypted messaging. My preferred messaging client is Telegram.

### What would be your dream setup?

_Music_: Most of my dream equipment is musical equipment, because it's generally the most inaccessibly expensive. More than anything, I'd love an MPC MIDI controller and sampler. Many of my favorite musical artists produce on an MPC, and while I have no experience using one, it's a workflow I'd really love to try. I'd also love an [Arturia Minibrute analog synthesizer][minibrute]. I almost bought it instead of the Novation Bass Station II mentioned above, but opted for the Bass Station due to the presence of presets. I'd love to upgrade my audio interface to a [Scarlett 4i4][scarlett-4i4] for a few more inputs, and my studio headphones to the unbeatable [Audio-Technica ATH-R70x][ath-r70x]. I've dreamed about the [Eventide Space reverb pedal][space] since I first encountered it in an improvisational synthesis video when I was first learning to produce music, but it's a lot of money to commit to just reverb and delay!

_Miscellaneous_: I'd love to be doing everything above on an [Apple Studio Display][studio-display.2] - I used to code using an [Apple Thunderbolt Display][thunderbolt-display] provided by my employer in the office, and I miss it! I've dreamed of a digital screen fan controller like the [Thermaltake Commander FT][commander-ft] since I was in high school, but that's mostly because they look _really_ cool. I've been curious about the Microsoft Surface as a dual tablet and laptop. I'd love a gaming keypad like the [Razer Tartarus][tartarus-pro] - not just for games but for macros in different kinds of studio software as well. Oh, and I want there to be an iPhone with the dimensions of the [iPhone 5S][iphone-5s] again. It was the perfect size and Apple hasn't made anything that small since. Finally, more than anything, I want there to be a new version of the [Razer Lachesis][lachesis], the only mouse to ever truly fit my grip. There has been nothing like it manufactured for nearly a decade now, and all the used ones are falling apart.
