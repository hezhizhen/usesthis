### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm [Zach Beane](https://xach.com/ "Zach's website."). I work on [Common Lisp][common-lisp] and homestead projects. My most popular project is [Quicklisp][], a library manager for Common Lisp.

### What hardware do you use?

For working with Common Lisp, I use a 2016 13" [MacBook Pro][macbook-pro], sometimes with an external 27" 4K monitor. For building Quicklisp I have a homebuilt Linux server with lots of memory and a fast SSD running virtual machines.

For homestead projects, I use a [John Deere 1070][1070] tractor with some attachments: a FransgÃ¥rd [V-4000 logging winch][v-4000], a Valby/Normet CH150 wood chipper, a John Deere Model 3 wood splitter, a Land Pride [RTR1872 rotary mower][rtr1872], a Bush Hog FM72 flail mower, and a Tartan/CountyLine rototiller. I make lumber and other sawn wood products with a Thomas 6013 bandsaw mill. I fell trees and buck logs with a Husqvarna [365 chainsaw][365]. Sometimes I use a smaller [435][435-e-series] for lighter jobs or as backup.

### And what software?

I've used the same core software for many years: [GNU Emacs][emacs], a web browser (currently [Safari][]), and [xterm][]. These translate pretty well to any environment, but I've used Mac laptops for 20 years so I run them on Mac.

When writing Common Lisp code I use the [SBCL][] implementation of Common Lisp. It produces fast machine code and has a big community of users and is actively developed. I deploy most of my Lisp code on [Debian][] Linux servers, fronted by [nginx][] proxies and static asset servers.

For Quicklisp hosting and distribution I use AWS [S3][] and [CloudFront][].

I used [Wunderlist][] for a few years for todo list tracking, but Microsoft bought it and turned it into Microsoft [To Do][to-do], so now I use that.

Within Emacs, I use [SLIME][] and [ParEdit][] for writing Lisp. I'd like to try [SLY][] as a replacement to SLIME but haven't been able to commit the time to switching. I take notes with [Org mode][org-mode] but I feel like I'm only scratching the surface of its functionality. I manage checkouts with [Magit][].

I keep various seasonal journals in [Google Docs][google-docs] - tracking my goals and progress for firewood management, orchard management, and maple syrup production.

### What would be your dream setup?

I really like my current setup and I'm blessed with a lot of nice tools and toys. So all this stuff is certainly dream territory, not stuff I truly need. With that said...

Computer hardware wishlist:

* Newer, faster laptop
* Rack of quiet, fast Linux servers

Software wishlist:

* xterm 7x14 font with emojis and better glyph coverage in general and XQuartz that understands multiple displays OR
* [iTerm2][] that exactly replicates xterm (then I could ditch XQuartz/xterm) without constant little missing parts that trip me up
* Multiple profile support in Safari (the one thing I miss from [Chrome][])
* Tight Common Lisp/Mac interaction and integration that compares to the old [MCL][macintosh-common-lisp] capabilities or Symbolics systems; not merely nostalgic emulation but supporting modern, native-style applications that are Lispy all the way down. Maybe it's not possible...

Homestead hardware wishlist:

* Bigger tractor - something in the 50-60HP range like a [4052M][]
* Smaller tractor for cultivation like a [Farmall Cub][farmall-cub] 
* Mini-excavator for digging and ditching
* Newer Husqvarna saw in the 70cc class - something like the [572 XP][572-xp]
* Fancier sawmill with hydraulics and a trailer package, like a Wood-Mizer [LT35][]
* A big barn to store everything under cover
