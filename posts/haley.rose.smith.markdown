### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm Haley, and I'm an [Android][] engineer & tech lead at [Slack][]. I grew up in Napa Valley and now live in Oakland with my husband, André, and my cat, River. When I'm not selling my labor, I'm attending a local [Farm School](https://18reasons.org/classes-events/2018-05-02/farm-school-2018 "The Farm School program for 2018.") program and working in my garden. I also cook a lot - a LOT - and can spend hours researching recipes and coming up with menus for dinner parties and cookouts. Other than that, I'm either [shitposting on Twitter](https://twitter.com/haley "Haley's Twitter account."), devouring a space opera or fantasy epic, or staring at the large black shrine in my living room.

### What hardware do you use?

At work I have a 15-inch touchbar [MacBook Pro][macbook-pro] laptop from 2016 that's almost always plugged into my ergonomic workstation setup. I have a sit/stand desk with an [ergonomic chair][discovery-back], a keyboard tray, a [Kinesis Freestyle2 Bluetooth keyboard][freestyle2-mac], and an [Evoluent vertical ergonomic mouse][verticalmouse]. I'm in love with the 27-inch [LG monitors][27mu88-w] that are standard at our Slack workstations - mine is mounted on an AmazonBasics monitor arm. I used to get terrible shoulder pain and pinched nerves, but ever since getting this ergonomic setup it's really improved a lot. For Android stuff I'm usually testing on a [Nexus 5X][nexus-5x]. I have an [Elago M2 stand][m2-stand] that I keep it on that's really convenient and nice.

Recently I got a pair of [JINS SCREEN][jins-screen] blue light-blocking glasses for working, with slightly weaker prescription for looking at a computer screen (I'm nearsighted). My migraines have decreased significantly! 

I almost never go on the computer at home unless I have to work from home for some reason, so when that happens I just plug into my husband's gaming setup, which is this rainbow light-up PC keyboard and a Razer mouse. My personal laptop is a 2010 MacBook Pro that I've shoved an SSD and extra RAM into. It does just fine.

For personal stuff, the most hardware I ever use is my [PS4][] plugged into an old 40" LG non-smart TV, and my Polk Omni soundbar. In addition to gaming, the PS4 functions as a set-top box - it has [Plex][], [Netflix][], [Crunchyroll][], all that stuff. Scattered throughout the house also a bunch of [Google Home][google-home] & Chromecast devices that I've gotten for free over the years of attending Google conferences. They kind of creep me out but I misplace my phone about 1000 times daily and it's so convenient to say "Hey Google, where's my phone?" to make it ring. I also have a [Nexus 9][nexus-9] (thanks, Google I/O 2015) on a stand in the kitchen that's basically a digital cookbook. 

My daily items are my trusty [Pixel 2][pixel-2] (yes, I upgrade every year, it's gross of me) running Android 8.1.0 because I'm not brave enough to run the 9.0 beta on my primary device, my Withings (no, Nokia) (no, Withings) [Activité Pop][activite-pop] step tracking watch, and my [Kindle Paperwhite][kindle-paperwhite] - did you know that the San Francisco Public Library allows patrons to check out e-books for free? You don't even have to live in San Francisco!

### And what software?

At work I basically live inside of Slack. We are absolute power users of our own product and fully 50% of my day is spent inside that sweet sweet Electron window. For development I use [Android Studio][android-studio], a fork of IntelliJ maintained by Google and full of goodies that make life easier for Android developers. Most Android applications are written in [Java][], but my team has also started incorporating [Kotlin][], a new programming language by JetBrains that now has official Google support. Our codebase is at about 15% and it's been fun to learn a new language for the first time in almost 10 years! 

My browser is [Chrome][], I take notes in [TextEdit][], and without [1Password][] I'd be locked out of my life forever. [Alfred][] is a huge productivity help for me, and I have [F.lux][] turned on max at all times to help prevent migraines. I love using [Dropbox Paper][dropbox-paper] to write documentation - we've used many different collaborative document editing tools over the years here and Paper is by far my favorite. 

At home, like I said I don't spend a lot of time on the computer, but [Pepperplate][] is this great recipe archiving app that has a backlog of every recipe I've stolen from the internet or come up with myself over the past 5 years. For crop management I use the open source website [Growstuff](http://www.growstuff.org/ "A food-growing community."). I also read constantly and for all its faults [Goodreads][] has been an excellent way to chronicle what I've read & get recommendations from friends. I listen to music on [Google Play Music][google-play-music], I talk to my friends on [Signal][], I track various aspects of my life with [Daylio][daylio-android], [Clue][clue-android], and [Migraine Buddy][migraine-buddy-android], and I manage my household's finances with [YNAB][]. My husband and I use [Wunderlist][] to collaborate on grocery lists and the like but I think Microsoft is sunsetting it soon so we need to find something else - probably [Google Keep][google-keep]? 

### What would be your dream setup?

We just bought a house so I'm really gunning for a 5.1 surround sound setup for our living room, but we are still struggling to figure out the best living room configuration. I've also been eyeing the [PS4 Pro][ps4-pro] and [PS4 Move][playstation-move]/[VR][playstation-vr] kits for ages but we already have an original PS4 _and_ a Slim so my husband and I don't have to take turns gaming. For the home office I'd love to get an [ErgoDox][] keyboard and one of those LG monitors for myself but I don't WFH enough to justify how expensive they are.
