### Who are you, and what do you do?

Hi! I'm [Pascal Finette](http://finette.com/ "Pascal's website."). In my day job I head up [Singularity University's](http://singularityu.org/ "An educational corporation.") [startup programs](http://startup.singularityu.org/ "A startup program.") and speak quite a bit about [entrepreneurship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmwIXJhoL1w "Pascal's YouTube video on entrepreneurship."), [technology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrgCq_1AVBo "Pascal's YouTube video on trends in technology.") and [impact](https://speakerdeck.com/pfinette/10-9-exponentials-and-impact "Pascal's slides about impact."). I also publish [The Heretic](http://theheretic.org/ "A newsletter for entrepreneurs."), a daily newsletter (and community) for entrepreneurs, founded or co-founded three non-profits ([The Coaching Fellowship](http://thecoachingfellowship.com/ "A coaching community."), [Power Up](http://powerup.us/ "A group entrepreneur gathering.") and [Mentor for Good](http://mentorforgood.org/ "A mentoring program for people working on social change.")), co-founded the [GyShiDo-Movement](http://gyshido.com/ "A movement for getting shit done."), am on the board of two incredible non-profits ([The Unreasonable Institute](http://unreasonableinstitute.org/ "An institution for helping entrepreneurs scale their problem solving.") and [CASH Music][cash-music]) and advise a couple of fantastic startups (e.g. [re:3D](http://www.re3d.org/ "A large-scale 3D printing service.") and [Standard Analytics](http://www.standardanalytics.io/ "A scientific publishing service.")).

I used to run [ultra-distance endurance races](http://ratracethewall.com/ "A 69-mile ultramarathon."); due to an injury, today I am a [TRX](https://www.trxtraining.com/ "A workout system.") devotee. I'm married to the incredible [Jane Finette](https://janefinette.com/ "Jane's website.") - together we own two dogs and a horse. I guess I keep myself busy.

### What hardware do you use?

I spend most of my time in front of a first-gen [13" MacBook Pro Retina][macbook-pro] (8GB RAM/256 GB HD). At home I sometimes use an [27" Apple Thunderbolt Display][thunderbolt-display] together with an [Apple Wireless Keyboard][keyboard] and a [Logitech M570 Trackball][wireless-trackball-m570]. We're connected through an [ASUS RT-N66U WLAN router][rt-n66u] and a previous-gen [2TB Apple AirPort Time Capsule][time-capsule] for [Time Machine][time-machine] backups (I found the WLAN portion of the Time Capsule somewhat unreliable - thus the ASUS RT-N66U router). I somewhat go back and forth between [Android][] and [iOS][] - my current phone is an [iPhone 6][iphone-6].

In my bag you either find a Fujifilm [Finepix X100][finepix-x100] camera or, when I need more versatility, a [Fujifilm X-E2][x-e2]. Talking about bags: I have a slight bag obsession and rotate through a couple of bags in the course of a week; my favorite bags at the moment are the [Filson Padded Briefcase][padded-computer-bag] and the [GORUCK Shoulder Bag][bombproof-shoulder-bag].

Lastly - I have an aversion against paper; a [Doxie One scanner][one.3] turns every piece of paper I ought to keep into a neat, little PDF.

### And what software?

During the day (aka Singularity University-time) I live mostly in my browser (primarily [Chrome][] these days) using [Google Apps][g-suite]. It's pretty remarkable how I pretty much never have the need to fire up any of the Microsoft products anymore... My team's work is organized in [Wunderlist][], we use [Teamreporter][teamreporter] at the end of the day to keep each other updated on progress and plans and communicate via [Slack][] throughout the day. As I do a fair bit of public speaking I am almost always whipping up new decks or refining my existing ones - they mostly are made in [Apple Keynote][keynote]; unless I need to pull something together on short notice in which case I love using [Deckset][]. And not to forget [Caffeine][] - an essential utility when you depend on your Mac not going to sleep while you present.

For all my other work I pretty much use plain text files everywhere - be it for my blogs (coding is done in [Sublime Text][sublime-text] and [Markdown][] files are written using [iA Writer][ia-writer]) or notes and research (which I keep in [nvALT][]). My websites are all built on top of [Jekyll][]; I use a bunch of custom [bash][] shell scripts in [iTerm2][] to keep everything humming smoothly.

All my image editing needs are fulfilled by [Pixelmator][], my whole user folder syncs to [Dropbox][] and a couple of neat, little utilities keep me sane: [Viscosity][] for using a VPN when I am on a public network; [Dashlane][] owns my passwords, [Noizio][] for focus-inducing nature-inspired whitenoise; [Spotify][] for all my music needs (take that [iTunes][]!); [aText][] for text expansion; [f.lux][] to keep my eyes from tearing up at the end of a long day; [VLC][] has long replaced Apple's QuickTime player for all my video watching cravings; [Tweetbot][] makes tweeting so much more fun; [Reeder][] takes care of my RSS reading needs; [Lyn][] replaced Apple's Preview and [JPEGmini][] crunches my photos down to a more manageable size.

### What would be your dream setup?

The one thing I want is a Retina MacBook in 12" - I can't stand the screen (and sharp edge) of the [MacBook Air][macbook-air]; the 11" MBA is too small and my 13" Retina MBP is just a tad too big and heavy. Oh - and while we're at it: Can we please have an iPhone the size and shape of the old [iPhone 3GS][iphone-3gs] but with all the goodies Apple put into the 6? The 6 is just too big, the 4 and 5 don't feel that great in my hand (I really don't care for the edge-design). Otherwise I just need good coffee to be happy and productive.
