### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm Dave Thomas, known online as [pragdave](https://pragdave.me/ "Dave's website."). I've been a programmer all my life, but not exclusively. I also write books, I was one of the authors of the Manifesto for Agile Software Development, I speak at conferences and give courses. Nowadays I also drive my tractor and do some woodturning. My current interests include trying to find ways to make it easier for developers to think about the design of their software.

### What hardware do you use?

For development I use a Samsung laptop running Linux. When I'm creating presentations I use my old 2015 [MacBook Air][macbook-air] (having spilled a cup of tea into my [MacBook Pro][macbook-pro]). I love my [Google Pixel][pixel] phone (mostly because of (a) the camera and (b) [Project Fi][google-fi] lets me travel the world without worrying about staying connected). I love my Osprey Elroy shoulder bag (and they replaced the original for free when I wore it out a few years back). Most of my work is done in an old, worn armchair overlooking the lake. I rigged up a [personal area stereo](https://pragdave.me/blog/2015/08/06/personal-area-stereo.html "Dave's post about his personal area stereo setup.") so I can listen to music without wearing headphones.

### And what software?

For presentations, I still haven't found anything better than [Keynote][], which is why I still have a Mac.

For coding, I was an [Emacs][] user for 30-ish years, but I recently gave up the fight and switched to [Visual Studio Code][visual-studio-code], which actually gives me everything Emacs did and more.

Source code is in [GitHub][], and languages include [Elixir][], [Ruby][], [Reason][reason.2], [JavaScript][], and whatever takes my fancy.

I run my [online course](http://codestool.coding-gnome.com/ "Dave's programming courses.") in Thinkific, and invoice using Wave. Most productivity stuff is in Google.

### What would be your dream setup?

I like coding in my armchair, with the lake in the background. But it would be extra nice to have a decent high-res second monitor which magically popped up out of the floor or down from the ceiling. And a bottomless cup of tea. Obviously.
