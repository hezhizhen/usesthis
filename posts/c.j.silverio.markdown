### Who are you, and what do you do?

My name is [C J Silverio](https://twitter.com/ceejbot "C J's Twitter account."), and I program computers, design software systems, and make teams work better. Right now I'm Principal Engineer at Eaze Technologies, a San Francisco company that provides services for legal cannabis delivery in California and Oregon.

### What hardware do you use?

Macintosh all the way. My first computer was an Apple [\]\[\+][ii-plus] and my second was a [Mac Plus][macintosh-plus]. The habit remains. Right now I have an older [Mac Pro][mac-pro] hooked up to all my music-making hardware, and two [MacBook Pros][macbook-pro] for programming work. One is a 13" with one of the bad keyboards, and the other is an employer-issued 15" with a good keyboard.

I have an [iPhone X][iphone-x] and one of the newer Apple Watches. I was extremely suspicious of the watch, and I could lose it tomorrow and probably not be all that upset.

### And what software?

[iTerm2][] is my terminal app. I switched from [zsh][] to [Fish shell][fish] a few years ago.

[Bear][] for note-taking and writing text intended for consumption outside of a git repo. (I'm using Bear to write this!) I like that it syncs and I can continue editing on my iPhone if I need to. I write almost everything in Markdown if I can, which makes [Deckset][] the idea slide presentation app for me.

I run [Visual Studio Code][visual-studio-code] for most other text editing. I keep the amazingly solid, trusty [BBEdit][] around for heavy text lifting.

In the terminal, I'll reach for [`vim`][vim], which I invoke as `vi` not `vim` because I am old and my fingers do things in the shell without conscious thought.

I use [Tweetbot][] on Mac and iOS for Twitter. My Mastodon app of choice on iOS is [Mast][mast-ios].

I run [Airmail][] on Mac & iOS to unify all my inboxes and so I can read email in a native application. 

My daily driver browser is [Safari][]. It is the best Macintosh application of all the browsers available today. I run [Choosy][] for on the fly choice about which browser to open a specific link with. My ad blocker is [uBlock Origin][ublock-origin].

I do my calendaring with [Fantastical][]. It offers a wonderful UX for adding new events quickly.

For diagramming, I use the amazing [Omnigraffle][].

I customize my Mac experience with a lot of little utilities. I love experimenting with new tools and I'll rotate new things in & out of my running set frequently. These have managed to stick around, however:

- [Alfred][] as my app launcher, with a number of workflows for things like reminding me about http status codes
- [Bartender][] for managing the zillion menu bar icons on smaller screens.
- [Dropzone][] for dragging and dropping across workspaces.
- [1Password][] for password management.
- [Moom][] for snapping window sizes.

Recently I've been trying out this little calculator app called [Numi][].

I use [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode "A font for software development.") everywhere I need a monospaced typeface. It has those sweet ligatures that make certain symbol combinations look like single characters, which helps code legibility for me.

### What would be your dream setup?

I would like a 13" MacBook Pro with a working keyboard. When I'm dreaming, I'll add to that 16GB of memory at least, a huganic SSD, and a battery that lasts 12 hours. (Maybe it's rocking an ARM processor?) But really, give me a working keyboard, a real ESC key, and the finger print reader on a current-generation MacBook, and I'd be happy.
