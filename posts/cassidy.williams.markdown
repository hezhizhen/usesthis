### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm [Cassidy](https://cassidoo.co/ "Cassidy's website."), and I'm a software engineer with way too many side projects. I love teaching other developers, and have several online classes out there, as well as a weekly newsletter and livestreaming channel. I also love building mechanical keyboards, and have several keycap designs shipped out to keyboard enthusiasts everywhere. You can find me @cassidoo on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cassidoo "Cassidy's Twitter account."), [GitHub](https://github.com/cassidoo "Cassidy's GitHub account."), [CodePen](https://codepen.io/cassidoo "Cassidy's CodePen account."), and most other things.

### What hardware do you use?

I use a Mac for work and a PC for everything else! My Mac is the new 2020 16" [MacBook Pro][macbook-pro], and my PC is a custom one with a [Intel Core i5-9600K][core-i5-9600k], a [Z390 DESIGNARE Gigabyte motherboard][z390-designare], memory is a Corsair Vengeance LPX 16 GB, a [GeForce GTX 1660 Ti graphics card][geforce-gtx-1660-ti], a Fractal Design case, and, drum roll... a CD drive! My keyboards are mechanical keyboards on rotation. I've got a CalDigit Thunderbolt 3 dock that I connect to both my PC and Mac and it's a cable switch to switch between them on my monitors (which are both 27" monitors, one an LG and one a BenQ).

### And what software?

I use [Bear][] for most of my note-taking. My only gripe with it is that it's Mac-only, so I don't use it as often as I normally would because of my PC! For other things like project tracking, I use [Notion][]. For daily task management, I actually use a to-do app I built myself called todometer. For coding I use [VSCode][visual-studio-code] or [vim][]. For presentations I use [Deckset][]. For design softwares, I use [Affinity Designer][affinity-designer] and [Affinity Photo][affinity-photo]. My calendar is [Vimcal][], and my terminal is [iTerm][iterm2]! I do most of my chatting on [Discord][] (but [Slack][] for work). 

### What would be your dream setup?

I basically want a makerspace/arcade around me. I have the nice office chair and the standing desk now, but I would *love* a larger space for big lights, a wide desk, and a more souped-up PC (mine can handle the streaming, but gaming and streaming at the same time can be a lot for it). The ability (and space) to have a pinball machine and an arcade box would be SO fun, as well as space for a laser cutter and 3D printer! Maybe someday!
