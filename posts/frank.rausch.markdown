### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm [Frank Rausch](https://frankrausch.com/ "Frank's website.") and I am a user interface designer, iOS app developer, and typographer. I consult, I teach, and I make apps.

### What hardware do you use?

A huge part of my design work requires deep thinking. The products I create are digital, but the most creative and meaningful ideas happen in my head and evolve on paper. I always carry a pocket-sized blank Moleskine and a [black Muji Gel Ink Ballpoint Pen, 0.38mm][gel-ink-ballpoint].

My main work device is a 13″ [MacBook Pro][macbook-pro], Late 2016 (3.1 GHz i5, 16 GB RAM, 1TB SSD). I was crazy enough to pre-order it when it first came out, and I think I got lucky: While the [keyboard does suck](https://daringfireball.net/linked/2017/10/17/johnston-macbook-keyboard "Gruber's article about Casey Johnston's piece on the newer MacBook Pro keyboards."), at least it still works. If only the keys had more travel - plus the old inverted-T arrow key layout and a proper escape key! The Touch Bar is useless to me because I never look at the keyboard while I type. I do appreciate the switch to USB-C and I don't mind having to use dongles for a while. I vividly remember people whining [when Apple killed the CD-ROM drive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Air#First_generation "The Wikipedia entry for the first generation MacBook Air.") or when Apple replaced the 30-pin dock connector with the much better Lightning plug. Or even when Apple's first [iMac][] didn't have a floppy disk drive! Sometimes advances in technology come with a period of inconvenience. I'm alright with that.

Laptop portability is important to me - I previously had a maxed-out [11″ MacBook Air][macbook-air] (Late 2014). I think it was my favorite computer to date. Not only because it  had a much, much, much better keyboard than all current Apple laptops, but because it was so incredibly small and lightweight.
	
Whenever I work at my desk, the MacBook Pro is tethered to an [LG UltraFine 5K][ultrafine-5k] monitor, a [Filco MajesTouch Ninja Tenkeyless][majestouch-ninja-tenkeyless] with Cherry MX Brown keys that I bought in 2013, and a [Logitech MX Master 2S][mx-master-2s]. For my left hand, I have an [Apple Magic Trackpad 2][magic-trackpad-2]. Yes, I use both pointing devices at the same time. Sounds weird, but I do my pointing with the right hand and my zooming and scrolling with my left hand. I highly recommend this setup. It feels super productive and professional and futuristic - and it puts less strain on the mousing hand.

I have collected a few generations of iOS devices to test my apps. My main phone is an [iPhone X][iphone-x].

### And what software?

I use [Alfred][] many times a day - to launch apps, to find documents and contacts, to navigate the file system, and to [access special characters][typefacts-workflow].

I design user interfaces in [Sketch][]. My designs are often indeed sketches rather than production-quality mockup, especially when I also get to code the actual product. Whenever I save production assets, I let [ImageOptim][] do its thing.

My apps are mades in [Xcode][]. All other coding, scripting, and text editing happens in [Sublime Text][sublime-text]. I am super fast with multi-cursor editing - it's a huge productivity win. For writing, I use mostly [iA Writer][ia-writer]. [Kaleidoscope][] is my go-to app for diffing code, text, and images.

[Keynote][] is what I use for all of my [public speaking](https://frankrausch.com/#talks "A list of Frank's talks.") and lectures.

The Terminal is great for all sorts of things. I run a customized [iTerm][iterm2] with [Oh my ZSH!][oh-my-zsh]. I manage my command line tools with [Homebrew][]; for example [ImageMagick][] for batch image processing and [ffmpeg][] to convert videos.

I use [GitUp][] and [Transmit][]. My to-do lists live in [Things][]. My web browser of choice is [Opera][].

My scripting and programming notes go into [nvALT][]. This is my one place to put all the code snippets and terminal commands that I know I'll forget right away but need later.
I wish I had [Stack Overflow][stack-overflow] when I [started programming][visual-basic] in the mid-90s.

The [CamingoCode][] font is my default for all writing tasks - not only for code, but also for emails and prose. I use versions of the [Monokai color theme][monokai-pro] in both Xcode and Sublime Text. [Novel Mono][novel-mono] is the typeface I use on my website and for correspondence.

On my iPhone, I look up stuff in my own Wikipedia reader app, [V for Wiki][v-for-wikipedia-ios]. Other apps that I frequently use are [Fantastical][fantastical-ios] and [Weather Line][weather-line-ios].

### What would be your dream setup?

I'm quite happy with my setup. It has become so much more powerful and reliable than the first computers I saw in the early 90s. Technology got better, but most software is still hard to use for many people. Seeing all those bad user interfaces all the time is a great motivation to keep teaching app design, usability, and typography. 

If I had one wish, I would love a powerful MacBook Air with low-profile mechanical keys.
