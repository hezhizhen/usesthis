### Who are you, and what do you do?

My name is [Tracy Chou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracy_Chou "Tracy's Wikipedia entry.") and I'm a software engineer and diversity advocate, currently hacking on some new ideas while also advising and investing in startups. 

I was previously an engineer at [Pinterest][] and [Quora][] and consulted for the U.S. Digital Service. I also co-founded the non-profit [Project Include](http://projectinclude.org/ "A diversity in tech non-profit.") and the initiative #MovingForward, and started the tech diversity data collection project "[Where are the Numbers?](https://github.com/triketora/women-in-software-eng "Tracy's women in engineering stats project on GitHub.")"

### What hardware do you use?

I'm currently on a late 2016 [MacBook Pro][macbook-pro], 13", with a Touch Bar. I deeply regret the MBP - 1: dongle life, 2: the lack of a physical escape key makes coding in [emacs][] very difficult, 3: the keys on the butterfly keyboard are constantly too loose or totally stuck, 4: so much beach ball. 

When I am not in digital nomad mode bopping from sublet to sublet, I like to plug into a [Thunderbolt Display][thunderbolt-display], and I use a [Magic Keyboard][magic-keyboard] and [Magic Mouse][magic-mouse]. At this exact moment, though, all my accessories are in storage somewhere in Yonkers and I'm just working off my laptop. 

As for my phone, I have an [iPhone 8][iphone-8]. 

### And what software?

My typical coding setup is emacs in [iTerm2][], with [Z Shell][zsh] for the shell. Depending on what I'm building, I like [Chrome][] for web development and debugging, and the [Expo][] toolchain for hacking on [React Native][react-native]. 

For longer-form writing, I switch somewhat randomly between [iA Writer][ia-writer], [Byword][], and [Medium][] (in the browser). I sometimes even use Medium's editor to compose even if I don't intend to publish on Medium, because it's so beautiful. 

For random notes or snippets, I use [nvALT][] on my computer synced to [Simplenote][] on my phone via [Dropbox][]. I track personal todo's in [Todoist][]. 

Other applications I use frequently: [1Password][], [Slack][], [PureVPN][], [Photoshop][], [LICEcap][] (for creating screencaps to be shared with teammates or added to [GitHub][] PRs, particularly for UI changes).

### What would be your dream setup?

I'd replace my MacBook Pro with a [MacBook Air][macbook-air]. Long live the MacBook Air!
