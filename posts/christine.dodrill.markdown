### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm [Christine Dodrill](https://christine.website/ "Christine's website."), a Senior SRE from the Seattle area who is currently in Montreal. I've worked at [Heroku][], [IMVU][] and [Pure Storage](https://www.purestorage.com/ "A flash storage company."), but am currently working at [Lightspeed POS](https://lightspeedhq.com/ "A point of sales technology company.").

On the side, I enjoy making things with computers. I have a [Twitter](https://twitter.com/theprincessxena "Christine's Twitter account.") and a presence on the [Fediverse](https://mst3k.interlinked.me/@cadey "Christine's Mastodon account."). Lately I've been experimenting with OS design in order to make it easier to end our industry's Intel monoculture.

### What hardware do you use?

Most of my computing is done via a 12.9" 2018 [iPad Pro][ipad-pro]. I really like the convenience of having nearly my entire digital life in one device. I have the [Smart Keyboard][smart-keyboard] and [Pencil][] for it too. I also have a 12" [MacBook][macbook.2] that I use whenever I need to do things in [macOS][], but this is getting less and less often as the iOS ecosystem gets more and more powerful. 

I have a dedicated server from [SoYouStart](https://www.soyoustart.com/ "A hosting company.") with 8 cores, 32 GB of ram and 2 TB of storage. I use that for most of my programming on the side.

I have an [iPhone XS][iphone-xs] and [Apple Watch series 3][apple-watch-series-3] as part of what I carry around every day. 

### And what software?

I develop my code inside [Emacs][] in [tmux][] via [SSH][]. On rare occasions I'll do local development with Emacs/[Textastic][textastic-ios], but that's only for things I can't do remotely.

### What would be your dream setup?

I'm pretty sure I have it already.
