### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm [Jesse Holden](http://jesseholden.com/ "Jesse's website."), and I've been a computer, video game, comic, art, music, movie, and writing dork since I was a lil' guy. In the past I've worked on [indie video games](http://www.sleazywizard.com/ "Jesse and Eran's little game dev group."), [podcasts](https://streampdx.com/ "A podcast news and guide site."), and [cartoons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fT5fDCt_9V4 "A YouTube video of Jesse's coffee cartoon."), and I've helped with weddings, live performances, [short films](https://vimeo.com/236347940/ "A Vimeo video asking people about getting online in the '90s.")... and [a wedding that was _also_ a live performance and short film](https://vimeo.com/45304002 "A Vimeo video of a live performance cum wedding.").

Since 2016 I've been collaborating with the ineffable [Matthew Bogart](https://www.matthewbogart.net/ "Matthew's website.") on a YA graphic novel series called [Incredible Doom](https://www.incredibledoom.com/ "A comic about growing up online in the '90s."), published in two volumes by Harper Alley. In addition to plundering my embarrassing teenage years to co-write the story, I also research and re-create the computer interfaces seen in the comic, which draw upon the [earliest days](http://www.bbsdocumentary.com/ "A documentary about bulletin boards.") of networked computing.

### What hardware do you use?

My home workstation is a [15-inch MacBook Pro][macbook-pro], which I've been using since 2017 when someone smashed my car window and stole my last one. (Coincidentally at the time I had the _first-ever_ print run of Incredible Doom Issue 1 in a box in my car alongside the laptop, but luckily for me the laptop thief lacked all taste and left the comics behind.) At my desk I use a [Logitech M720 mouse][m720-triathlon] and a [Microsoft Sculpt ergonomic keyboard][sculpt-ergonomic-keyboard], [AudioEngine A2 speakers][a2-plus], [Blue Yeti microphone][yeti], and [Dell U2419H displays][u2419h], all plugged into an [APC Smart-UPS 750][smt750c].

We designed and built the "[Feelies](https://www.incredibledoom.com/news/2018/1/12/announcing-feelies "A post about the feelies included with mini issues of Incredible Doom.")" - the physical artifacts from the story that we included with the original minis - using my [Cricut Explore One][explore] which is an injket-printer-sized die cutting machine that's mostly marketed to hobbyists and scrapbookers, but which let us produce some really [intricate and special objects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWevJpKMHAk "A YouTubge video showing some of the Incredible Doom feelies.") for subscribers.

In the odd cases where I'm helping actually draw the comic, I also use an [iPad Pro][ipad-pro] with a first-generation [Apple Pencil][pencil].

### And what software?

I build all of the CLI computer screens in Incredible Doom by just typing them out in a simple rich text editor. Specifically that'd be [TextEdit][], the descendant of [TeachText][]/[SimpleText][] that's come with every Mac since the dark ages. This includes both the text-based software interfaces as well as the ASCII and ANSI art I create for the book. (I don't use any of the various ASCII/ANSI art generators or '[painting][rexpaint]' [tools][jave] that are available, but some artists swear by them!) Once the screens are composed, they're transplanted into the master file that goes to the publisher, which is an [Adobe InDesign][indesign] file that Matt and I share on [iCloud Drive][icloud-drive]. [Clip Studio Paint on iPad][clip-studio-paint-ios] is what I use when I help a little with the illustration part.

I often overcomplicate the process of researching those interfaces and text-art styles, but I find it so rewarding to try to get all of the little details right. Some material is inspired by or adapted from Jason Scott's [extraordinary USENET file archives](http://textfiles.com/ "An archive of files from Usenet."), as well as an ancient repository from Mike Jittlov called "Jittlov's NetWit" that I've managed to hold onto since the '90s when I downloaded it from an early Subgenius website. I also found the archives at [Defacto2](https://defacto2.net/ "An archive of PC hacking/warez history.") miraculous and _indispensable_ to some of the BBS scenes in Volume 2, especially the full session dumps.

In rare cases I've had to actually build and run a CLI app like [PINE][] or connect to a legitimate BBS to make sure I got the UI correct for one of the screens in the book. For those situations I use [iTerm2][], or I'll pore over [original changelogs from the 1990s](https://web.archive.org/web/20051125141739/http://www.washington.edu/pine/changes.html "An archived version of Pine's changelogs.") to make sure the features and UI elements I want to include actually existed in the exact year an issue takes place. [TelnetBBSGuide](https://www.telnetbbsguide.com/ "A directory of Internet-accessible BBSes.") also lets you connect to quite a few terminal-accessible BBSes right from your browser via [HtmlTerm](https://www.digitaldial.us/fterm/Example_HtmlTerm.html "A web-based BBS terminal."), which has been a huge boon for learning how some of these platforms worked and how users interact(ed) with them. For our [promo videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtNKxY6im1Y "A YouTube promotional video for Incredible Doom.") and [fun clips](https://www.youtube.com/c/MatthewBogart "Matthew's YouTube account."), the 'live' captured screens that we created were built in the Mac terminal emulator [Cathode][] by Secret Geometry - now sadly defunct, but still extremely gorgeous if you love that aesthetic as much as I do. 

(There's an easter egg associated with Volume 2 out there that I'm not allowed to talk about, but suffice it to say I built it with [Coda][], [Pixelmator][], and _copious_ usage of the [Wayback Machine][wayback-machine] and [GifCities][].)

### What would be your dream setup?

Incredible Doom started as an Indie project in the purest sense, with Matt and I doing everything from scratch; from writing the script to making promotional videos to laying out and drawing the comic to printing mailing labels to developing our pre-press flow to recording video chats and story meetings for [Patreon][] backers and a youtube/podcast series.  So even though I'd _love_ to say my dream setup is the simplest possible set of tools, with the _smallest_ possible chance for some part of it to crash or fail - like only an iPad with Apple Pencil or even just paper and pen (I favor the [Uni-Ball Signo DX][signo-dx], personally) - practically speaking that's just not enough to cover the multitude of things you're called upon to do as a DIY creator working and finding an audience online.


With that being said, I continue to appreciate everything Apple does to make their Mac hardware, OS, and software a powerful but accessible Swiss Army Knife for the innumerable requirements of working as an Indie in any creative field.  My next computer will probably be the 14- or 16-inch M1 Macbook Pro and I can't imagine needing much more than that.

Well, that and my [Playdate][], of course :)
