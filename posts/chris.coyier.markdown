### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm [Chris Coyier](https://chriscoyier.net/ "Chris' website."). I co-founded a social coding site for front-end developers called [CodePen][]. I run a site where I write about building websites, along with a small staff of writers and lots of guest authors called [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/ "A website about building websites."). And I also have a podcast with my friend Dave Rupert called [ShopTalk Show](https://shoptalkshow.com/ "A podcast about building websites."), which is all about, perhaps you can guess it: building websites. 

### What hardware do you use?

I'm a fairly clich√© Mac guy. After my first [Commodore 64][commodore-64] (and then [128][commodore-128]), the only computers I've ever had have been from Apple. I'm a longtime loyalist in that way and I don't regret a second of it. I use the 2018 [MacBook Pro][macbook-pro] tricked out as much as they would sell it to me. It's the main tool for my job, so I've always made sure I had the best equipment I can. A heaping helping of luck and privilege have baked themselves into moderate success for me such that I can afford that. 

At the office, I plug it into two of those LG [UltraFine 4k][ultrafine-4k] monitors, a Microsoft [Ergonomic Keyboard][sculpt-ergonomic-keyboard], and a Logitech [MX Master][mx-master] mouse. I plug in some Audioengine [A2s][a2-plus] for speakers. Between all those extras, the desk is more cluttered in wires than I would like and I look forward to an actually wireless future.  

I'm only at the office say 60% of the time and aside from that just use the MacBook Pro as it is. I'm probably a more efficient coder at the office, but my work is a lot of email and editing and social media and planning and such that is equally efficient away from the fancy office setup.
 
### And what software?

- [FaceTime][] for family face to face chat.
- [ScreenFlow][] for big long-form screen recordings.
- [Kap][] for small short-form screen recordings.
- [CleanMyMac][] for tidying up.
- [Local][local-by-flywheel] for local [WordPress][] development.
- [VS Code][visual-studio-code] for writing code.
- [TablePlus][] for dealing with databases.
- [Tower][] for Git.
- [iTerm][iterm2] for command line work.
- [Figma][] for design.
- [Mailplane][] to have a tabbed in-dock closable Gmail app.
- [Bear][] for notes/[Markdown][] writing.

### What would be your dream setup?

I'd happily upgrade to a tricked out 16" MacBook Pro. If I'm just throwing money at things I'd also happily take Apple's [Pro Display XDR][pro-display-xdr]'s, but the price on those is a little frightening. I already have it pretty good, so I don't do a ton of dreaming out what could be better.
