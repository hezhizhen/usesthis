### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm [Ryn Daniels](http://twitter.com/rynchantress/ "Ryn's Twitter account.") and I'm a web operations engineer at [Etsy][]. I also do a fair amount of [speaking at conferences](http://ryn.works/speaking/ "Ryn's talks."), often about devops and other things related to tech culture. When I'm not arguing with computers, I brew beer, make hot sauce, climb rocks, and play violin.

### What hardware do you use?

At work I have a [13" MacBook Pro Retina][macbook-pro] with 256GB SSD and 16GB memory. I have [an adjustable laptop stand][adjustable-folding-ventilated-laptop-table] to keep it at the right height, and a Samsung 22" LCD as an external display. I've got a [Logitech G500 mouse][g500] and the [Apple Bluetooth keyboard][keyboard] as well. The [Beyerdynamic DT-770-PRO-32 headphones][dt-770-pro] take care of all my music-listening needs at the office.

At home I have a [13" MacBook Air][macbook-air] with 128GB SSD and 8GB memory. When one of those needs to come with me, it goes in a [CaseLogic sleeve][laps-113] which goes in my [Columbia Treadlite 10][treadlite-10] which is hands-down my favorite backpack ever. It fits a 13" laptop, my [11" Grid-It][grid-it] that's keeping all my cables, adapters, and other miscellany organized, it's water-resistant and very low-profile for easy commuting. When I'm speaking, I use the [Logitech R400 wireless presenter][wireless-presenter-r400].

My phone is the [Nexus 5][nexus-5], often found with a set of [JLab J5M earbuds][jbuds-j5m] for music on the go. And of course I couldn't do without my [Hue Kard][hue-kard] for when I need emergency phone charging. I also wear a [Jawbone UP24][up24] so I can keep track of how being on-call affects my sleep. 

### And what software?

On a daily basis I find myself using [Gmail][], [Google Docs/Drive][google-docs], [Radiant Player][radiant-player], and [vim][]. A lot of my work gets done in [iTerm2][] with [zsh][] running a modified version of [oh-my-zsh's][oh-my-zsh] [agnoster theme](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/blob/master/themes/agnoster.zsh-theme "The agnoster theme for zsh."). Both of my laptops have [ClipMenu][], [Caffeine][], [Spectacle][], and [Seil][pckeyboardhack] installed (and my caps lock key is re-mapped to escape).

When I'm wrangling servers I use [Chef][] and liberal helpings of [knife-spork][knifespork]. [grep][], [awk][], [sed][], and [htop][] are there for troubleshooting. Code of course gets pushed to [GitHub][]. I chat with coworkers on IRC, either by way of [irssi][] running in a [screen][] session or Etsy's homegrown IRC client called F-Train. When I need to talk to remote coworkers, I use [Vidyo][].

[Talon for Android][talon-android] takes care of my Twitter habit. [Feedly][] is where I keep my RSS feeds, and [Pocket][] saves articles I want for offline reading, without which I wouldn't survive the subway. Same with [the Kindle app][kindle-android], though only for fiction - for non-fiction I still prefer dead tree format! [Chrome][] handles all my web browsing, [LastPass][] deals with my passwords, and [Duo][] takes care of 2-factor auth. When I'm giving talks I use [Keynote][], upload my slides to [Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/rdaniels/ "Ryn's slides."), and get a lot of slide pictures from [cat.technology](http://cat.technology/ "A weblog with photos of cats and technology."). I've also been using [HabitRPG][] as a fun to-do list manager and habit builder.

### What would be your dream setup?

I'd love to have a 13" MacBook Air with a Retina display. Of course a phone with better battery life (and that can fit in my pants pockets somehow!). A really amazing chair, at a desk that's [covered in cat pictures](https://twitter.com/rynchantress/status/504321851154509825 "A picture of Ryn's desk and laptop covered in cat photos."). And if someone could go ahead and invent teleportation, that would be great.
