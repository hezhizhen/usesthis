### Who are you, and what do you do?

Hello! I'm [Terra](https://terrafield.me/ "Terra's website.") ([she/her](https://pronoun.is/she "Terra's pronouns.")). I'm a Systems Engineer (mostly working on [Hadoop][]/[Kafka][]/"Big Data") by trade, though recently my life has been more occupied by ["trans activism"](https://rainofterra.com/it-was-never-about-dave-9aee8b765978 "Terra's post about Dave Chappelle's Netflix special.") which is what they call it when you're trans and get really mad about something on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/RainofTerra "Terra's Twitter account.").

I live in San Francisco, CA with my partners and our cats, though I am still a [Jersey Girl](https://youtu.be/PAa2KuxXSYw?t=74 "A YouTube video of the video clip for the song 'Big Casino' by Jimmy Eat World.") at heart. I mostly play video games ([Destiny 2][destiny-2], [FF14][final-fantasy-xiv], [Pok√©mon Shining Pearl][pokemon-shining-pearl], and [Metroid Dread][metroid-dread] at the moment) and watch YouTube cooking shows when not working.

### What hardware do you use?

Previously I split my time between a personal [iMac Pro][imac-pro] and a work [MacBook Pro][macbook-pro]. Since I recently left my job, I decided it was time to consolidate. I traded in my iMac Pro for an MacBook Pro 14" (M1 Max/64GB RAM/2TB SSD) and I have to say this is the best computer I've ever owned. I've never been a fan of laptops as a primary computing device because I'm forever pushing up against their [thermal limits](https://twitter.com/_MG_/status/1462651495124373506 "A tweet showing thermal imaging of Intel vs. Apple Silicon laptop heat generation."), but the new Apple Silicon has really changed my mind. I don't feel like I'm sacrificing anything for portability anymore.

As for peripherals, I've got a [ThunderBolt dock][thunderbolt-4-dock] at my work desk in our office and at my desk in our game room. I use a [Magic Trackpad][magic-trackpad] and [Magic Keyboard with Touch ID][magic-keyboard-with-touch-id]. When I'm at my work desk the dock is connected to two [Dell U2720QM monitors][u2720qm] that I run at an effective resolution of 2560 \* 1440, one in landscape the other in portrait (which is usually where my terminals go) with my MBP on the left on a Rain Design [iLevel stand][ilevel]. Three displays is really handy for work since it feels like I always have a [Zoom][zoom.2] meeting going. I also have a [Yeti X Blue microphone][yeti-x] on a boom and a pair of [AirPods Max][airpods-max] at this desk since I do most of my video conferencing from my work desk.

When I'm at my other desk (where I do most of my personal writing) I connect to a single [HP Z27k G3 monitor][z27k-g3] also running at 2560 \* 1440, with my MBP in clamshell mode on a [Rain Design mStand][mstand].

To the right of that is my Windows gaming PC that I've built and upgraded over the years. Current specs are: an [Intel i7 8700K][core-i7-8700k] overclocked to 5GHz, 32GB of DDR4 RAM, [Asus Prime Z390-A motherboard][prime-z390-a], various NVMe and SATA SSDs to hold all the video games I barely have the time to play, an [EVGA Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 FTW3][geforce-rtx-3090] that I bought at a local shop last year (and could never have guessed that paying MSRP for it would seem like such a bargain now), a [Corsair RM850x PSU][rm850x], a [Noctua NH-D15S CPU cooler][nh-d15s], all living in a [Fractal Design Define 7 XL case][define-7-xl] that was a dream to work with.

When gaming, I use a [ASUS ROG Swift PG27UQ 27" 4K 144Hz G-SYNC monitor][rog-swift-pg27uq]. I switch between [HyperX Cloud Alpha headphones][cloud-alpha] and a [Corsair SP2500 2.1 speaker set][sp2500] I've had since 2011. I use a Leopold Tenkeyless keyboard with Cherry MX Blue switches and a [Logitech G502 wireless mouse][g502] running on a PowerPlay charging mat.

As for portable gaming, I have a [Nintendo Switch][switch.2] that I use around the house (we have a few docks) and a [Switch Lite][switch-lite] that I use on the go (because it is pink and it fits in my purse). The Nintendo Cloud syncing works a lot better than I expected.

Last, in our garage we have a small rack that has a couple [HP 290-P0043W][slimline-290-p0043w] with [Intel Celeron G4900 CPUs][celeron-g4900], 32GB of RAM, and cheap NVMe SSDs. These run [Ubuntu 20.04][ubuntu] and have a bunch of [Docker][] containers for things like [Plex][] for hosting video files and [Homebridge][] for connecting non-HomeKit devices to HomeKit. We have a [Synology DS1813+][ds1813-plus] in there as well with a [DX513 expansion unit][dx513] that we store media on and use as a target for [Time Machine][time-machine] backups as well as btrfs snapshots.

### And what software?

On my Mac I use [iTerm2][] and [tmux][] with a 6-pane setup and multiple windows. Every few months things become unruly and I declare tmux bankruptcy and start my session over. I do all of my shell editing in [neovim][], my GUI editing in [Sublime Text 4][sublime-text], and for bigger [Python][] or [Scala][] projects I use [IntelliJ][intellij-idea]. I use [pyenv][] to manage my Python environments. Most of my ops work happens in [the cloud](https://xkcd.com/908/ "An xkcd comic about the cloud."), but when I do need an actual local Linux environment I either use the [VMWare Fusion][vmware-fusion] M1 Technical Preview to spin up an Ubuntu VM, or ssh into one of the boxes in our rack. For browsing, I still use [Chrome][]. I miss [Lynx][].

As for writing, I do most of my writing in [Ulysses][]. I love that I can just have an idea, jot it down in Ulysses on my phone, and it'll show up on my Mac later when I go to write. Sometimes I even remember what the note I left myself meant!

For gaming, I use [Windows 11][windows-11] (I tend to be an early adopter, I just can't help but click the update button when offered). I still use Sublime for all my Windows text editing (mostly [AutoHotkey][] and [PowerShell][windows-powershell] scripts). I use [Nvidia's ShadowPlay feature][shadowplay] to capture my various gaming [hijinks](https://twitter.com/RainofTerra/status/1463434068331163652 "Terra's tweet showing off her Battlefield 2042 gameplay.").

No matter which platform I'm on, I use a billion different chat/social media apps to keep in touch with folks. [Twitter][], [Telegram][], and [Signal][] are probably my most used. I do miss the days when contacts showing up on Telegram just meant they were furries, now I have to determine if the person I haven't talked to since 2007 but still had in my contacts is a furry [or a nazi](https://www.splcenter.org/news/2021/02/16/how-encrypted-messaging-platform-changing-extremist-movements "An SPLC article about extremists using encrypted messaging platforms."). Lame.

### What would be your dream setup?

Honestly, I'm pretty sure I have it. I've always wanted a single laptop that I could do all of my work on no matter where I am and now I have that and the only thing I have to do when I get home is plug in a single cable and pick up right where I left off. It is lovely.
